# Introduction

Welcome to the Developer Notes of the `neurostatslib` project. These notes are a compilation of detailed technical information about the various modules, classes, and functions that make up this library. They are intended to help current and future developers understand the design decisions, structure, and functioning of the library, and to provide guidance on how to modify, extend, and maintain the codebase.

## Intended Audience

These notes are primarily intended for the following groups:

- **Current Developers**: The Developer Notes can serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding the library, making it easier to debug, modify and maintain the code.

- **Future Developers**: These notes can help onboard new developers to the project, providing them with detailed explanations of the codebase and its underlying architecture.

- **Contributors**: If you wish to contribute to the `neurostatslib` project, the Developer Notes can provide a solid foundation of understanding, helping to ensure that your contributions align with the existing structure and design principles of the library.

- **Advanced Users**: While the primary focus of these notes is on development, they might also be of interest to advanced users who want a deeper understanding of the library's functionality. 

Please note that these notes assume a certain level of programming knowledge. Familiarity with Python, object-oriented programming, and the NumPy, Scipy and Jax libraries would be beneficial when reading these notes.

## Navigating the Developer Notes

The Developer Notes are organized into sections, each dedicated to a different module or class within the `neurostatslib` library. Each section provides an overview of the class or module, a description of its role and functionality within the library, and a detailed guide to its methods and attributes.
